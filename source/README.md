About the project
-----------------

In the world of science, programming and formulae, there is the concept of finite automaton[^1], so called finite-state machine or just state machine — the abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time — and it is the only purpose of this project's existence.

And this state machine, can provide to you the solutions for your task at the same time in a limited way, but also infinite potential — abstract problems call for abstract solutions, this is the philosophy of this project.

<!-- PREREQUISITES:
 -->

### Prerequisites

For usage of this project just as it is for your repository, there is no direct requirement for [Node.js](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/).

But, for contributing to this project, we highly recommending following those prerequisites:

- Installed [Node.js](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/) on your desktop on which you will edit/setup this project;
- Installed [Python](https://www.python.org/) if you want to contribute to the scripts of this project (in terms of .PY scripts);
- Any potentional IDE or text-editor with .NET native support (better if with support of NUGET), like [“Visual Studio”](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and etc.;\
    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ \
    https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Installed [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/) on your working machine: direct requirement BOTH for contributing and using the project.

<!-- INSTALLATION:
 -->

### Installation

> Permission is granted for free use in any of your products.
>
If you want to use this project, there are multiple ways to download-and-use this project: two “official” and direct, so, let's start from simplest official path:

Process of installation within NUGET package manager in VS:

1. Open project in IDE with .NET native-support;
2. Use the specified package manager in your IDE (in VS - find this in upper hotbar):\
   if we talking about VS, load project via solution explorer and then proceed with "Project → Manage Nuget Packages" and then navigate through UI with help of:\
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio/
3. Write the name of this package into packages browser;
4. download the required for you version through the menu and package is ready-to-use.

> If you are interested in importing DLL of this package into your project, read this article:\
> https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/native-library-loading/

Guidelines for direct-installation way:

1. Download last tag on project's repository, for the last ZIP-tarball link provided below:\
   [download latest release](https://github.com/Falcion/Zustandsmaschine/releases/latest/)
   - or just download the source-code through "Code → Download ZIP (or any option that you want)", and proceed to the next step;
2. Within downloaded ZIP (or project), clone everything and paste to the directory of your project via "copy+paste" procedure;
3. Add namespace as dependency for your own namespaces (in case if you cloned the source into your project) and the project is ready-to-use.

Guidelines for installation of source code of this project:

1. Clone the repository with any form of app which supports git (or CLI of this site), guide is attached:\
   https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/
2. Open it with any suitable for you editor and feel free to customize, update and/or contribute to this project[^2].

<!-- USAGE:
 -->

Usage
-----

As it was stated in introduction about the project, this solution provides very abstract and hard-to-use (advanced) interpretation of state machine and it could be used in alike abstract code representations, but for basics:

- Staging any function, method (and requests which are represented by them) with states and shifts;
- Interpretating the steps of any code and configs within advanced internal analytics engine inside the stateflows assemblers;
- Staging not just functions and methods, but entire logic and messaging system via state-usage logic of project.

For usage instructions:

1. Download and install this project into your's one with help of installation guides[^3];
2. Now, you can continue to work on your project with this package's data in it.

> Before preparing to contribute on the project, initialize entire repository via initialize and prepare commandlets of NPM (through either bash or powershell):

<br/>

```bash
# Installing every dependency for package:
npm i
# Using prepare script for this repository:
npm run prepare
```
