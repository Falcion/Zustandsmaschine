## Security Issue Reporting Guidelines

The creator and head of the developer team take the security of their software, products, and services seriously. This commitment extends to all source code repositories managed under their control, including those belonging to organizations.

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any of their products or software (as defined by the MIT License), please follow the guidelines below to report it.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you prefer to submit the report without logging in, you can send an email to the address specified in the code of conduct or the one provided below. Alternatively, you can visit DEV.TO. If possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key.

- [Outlook Email](mailto:io.falcion@outlook.com)

**Please refrain from reporting security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or pull requests.**

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the issue:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of the source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

**English language is preferred for reporting security vulnerabilities.**

Providing this information will enable us to triage your report more efficiently.

### Security Policy

Following the principle of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), researchers are encouraged to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and services directly to the vendors of the affected product. Alternatively, researchers can report the vulnerabilities to a national CERT or other coordinator, who will then report them to the vendor privately. Another option is to use a private service that will also report the vulnerabilities to the vendor privately.

By adhering to CVD, researchers allow the vendor the opportunity to diagnose and provide fully tested updates, workarounds, or other corrective measures before any party discloses detailed vulnerability or exploit information to the public. Throughout the vulnerability investigation, the vendor maintains coordination with the researcher and provides updates on the progress of the case.

Once an update is released, the vendor may recognize the researcher for their research and privately reporting the issue. In cases where attacks are already underway in the wild, and the vendor is still working on the update, the researcher and vendor collaborate as closely as possible to provide early public vulnerability disclosure to protect customers. The objective is to offer timely and consistent guidance to customers in order to help them protect themselves.

For more information on CVD, please refer to the following resources:

### Signing the CLA (Contributor License Agreement)

In some cases, you may be required to sign the CLA (Contributor License Agreement) before your pull request can be accepted. Signing the CLA is a quick and straightforward process.

- For individuals: [Google Individual CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
- For corporations: Print, sign, scan, and email or mail the provided form: [Google Corporate CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate)

If you have multiple accounts or multiple email addresses associated with a single account, ensure that you sign the CLA using

 the primary email address associated with your GitHub account, the one you use to author git commits and submit pull requests.

If you encounter any issues with your accounts or multiple email addresses, the following documents can assist you in resolving them:

- [Setting Your Commit Email Address in Git](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git/)
- [About Commit Email Addresses](https://help.github.com/articles/about-commit-email-addresses/)
