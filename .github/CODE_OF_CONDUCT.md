## Preamble

All participants of this project are expected to abide by this code of conduct, both online and during in-person events associated with this organization. This project aims to foster an open, innovative, and inclusive community around open source. To clarify expected behavior in the community, we have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Commitment

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We are committed to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Behavior

The primary purpose of this community is to collaborate on software projects. We encourage community members to follow these guidelines to inform their interactions on our platform. By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge each other's ideas while remaining respectful and allowing space for open contribution.

### Positive Behavior

To foster a safe and productive environment, we encourage community members to adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Be welcoming and open-minded:** Embrace other ideas and experience levels, welcome new collaborators, and respect diverse perspectives.
- **Be respectful:** Engage in thoughtful and constructive criticism, criticize ideas rather than people, and treat others with courtesy.
- **Be empathetic:** Understand and respect the feelings and experiences of others, and create a community where everyone feels safe to contribute and share ideas.
- **Improve the discussion:** Contribute to productive discussions, stay on topic, and provide relevant and valuable context when sharing links.
- **Share mindfully:** Only share valuable and relevant resources, avoid unsolicited links, and refrain from sharing sensitive information.

### Negative Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or public/private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Not respecting reasonable communication boundaries.
- Using sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Swearing or using strong or disturbing language.
- Demonstrating graphics or content that may be considered disturbing.
- Promoting or assuming any kind of inequality or discrimination.
- Promoting drug use or any other illegal activities.
- Attacking personal tastes or preferences.
- Engaging in any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Violations of the code of conduct may be reported by sending an email to [io.falcion@outlook.com](mailto:io.falcion@outlook.com) or by creating an issue in the discussions section. We take all reports seriously and will investigate and respond accordingly. The specific actions we take will depend on the circumstances, and we may remove comments or contributions that violate the code of conduct. Temporary or permanent suspensions may also be issued for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.
