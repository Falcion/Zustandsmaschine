<p align="right"><a href="#readme-top" title="Back to the top of MD file">[^]</a></p>

#### Positive behaviour

In order to foster both a safe and productive environment, we encourage our community members to look to these guidelines to inform how they interact on our platform - below, you’ll find some suggestions for how to have successful interactions as a valued member of the community:

- Engage with consideration and respect.

  - **Be welcoming and open-minded.**\
    New users join our community each day, some are well-established developers, while others are just beginning: be open to other ideas and experience levels, make room for opinions other than your own and be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started.

  - **Be respectful.**\
    Working in a collaborative environment means disagreements may happen, but remember to criticize ideas, not people, share thoughtful, constructive criticism and be courteous to those you interact with - if you’re unable to engage respectfully, consider taking a step back or using some of our moderation tools to deescalate a tense situation.

  - **Be empathetic.**\
    Github is a global community with people from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own: try to put yourself in others shoes and understand their feelings before you address them, do your best to help make this community where others feel safe to make contributions, participate in discussions, and share different ideas.

- Contribute in a positive and constructive way.

  - **Improve the discussion.**\
    Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small: if you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

    The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too: be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

  - **Be clear and stay on topic.**\
    GitHub community is for collaboration, sharing ideas, and helping each other get stuff done, off-topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive: staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions.

    Criteria of this applies to sharing links, as well: any links shared in community discussions should be shared with the intent of providing relevant and appropriate information. links should not be posted to simply drive traffic or attention to a site and should always be accompanied by a full explanation of the content and purpose of the link, posting links, especially unsolicited ones, without relevant and valuable context can come across as advertising or serving even more malicious purposes.

  - **Share mindfully.**\
    When asking others to give you feedback or collaborate on a project, only share valuable and relevant resources to provide context, don't post links that don't add value to the discussion, and don't post unsolicited links to your own projects or sites on other user's threads.

    Additionally, don't share sensitive information, this includes your own email address. We don't allow the sharing of such information in community, as it can create security and privacy risks for the poster, as well as other users. If you'd like to invite other users to collaborate on a project or work with you, share a link to the repository in which the project you are working on exists, you can also add others as outside collaborators on your project repo to give them special permissions to help you develop your project.

  - **Keep it tidy.**\
    Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up.

    - **DON'T** start a discussion in the wrong category.
    - **DON'T** cross-post the same thing in multiple discussions.
    - **DON'T** post no-content replies.
    - **DON'T** bump posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.
    - **DON'T** divert a discussion by changing it midstream.
    - **DON'T** post supportives, instead, use the upvote button, rather than taking an existing discussion in a radically different direction, open a new discussion.

- Be trustworthy.

  - **Always be honest.**\
    Don’t knowingly share incorrect information or intentionally mislead other сommunity participants - шf you don’t know the answer to someone’s question but still want to help, you can try helping them research or find resources instead, moderators and higher contributors will also be active in community, so if you’re unsure of an answer, it’s likely a moderators will be able to help.

In our community, there are a variety of actions that we may take in response to inappropriate behavior or content, it usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case: we recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons, perhaps, they didn't realize how their words would be perceived or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them, of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble.

Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation, we'll review each situation on a case-by-case basis: in each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using this code of conduct to guide our decision.

Any report will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances: further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project hold the right and responsibility to remove comments or other contributions that are not aligned to this contributor covenant, or to ban temporarily or permanently any members for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
